### Statistical Physics view of theory of Machine Learning

Short 1h30 tutorial I gave at [ACDL 2022](https://acdl2022.icas.cc/). I have prepared some high-level [slides](/assets/pdf/slides_acdl2022.pdf) and covered one detailed classic calculation in the field, namely the deterministic limit of one-pass SGD dynamics for two-layers neural networks, highlighting also some recent developments from [our recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00293) to appear in NeurIPS 2022. You can this in the [lecture notes](/assets/pdf/notes_acdl2022.pdf) I prepared for the school.  

### Statistical Physics For Optimization and Learning

Between 2020-2022 I was a teaching assistant (TA) for this advanced course on statistical physics methods for learning, constraint satisfaction and inference problems taught by Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborov√° at EPFL. Lecture notes, exercises and corrections can be found in the [course webpage](https://sphinxteam.github.io/EPFLDoctoralLecture2021/).

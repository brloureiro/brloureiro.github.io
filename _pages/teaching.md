### Princeton Machine Learning Theory Summer School 2024

Course that I have at the [Princeton ML theory summer school](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/) on "Statistical physics for machine learning". You might be interested in the [lecture notes](/assets/pdf/NotesPrinceton_BL.pdf).

### PSL Week "Statistical Physics and Machine Learning"

Week's long advanced course on selected topics from Machine Learning theory and their relationship to Statistical Physics, co-organised with [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/) and [Giulio Biroli](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/giulio-biroli/). You might be interested in the [lecture notes](/assets/pdf/psl_week_notes_sgd.pdf) I have prepared for the SGD part of the week.

### Wonders of high-dimensions: the maths and physics of Machine Learning

A 3h long tutorial I gave at [ACDL 2023](https://acdl2023.icas.cc/). You can find the slides I have prepared here: [Lecture 1](/assets/pdf/slides_acdl2023_L1.pdf), [Lecture 2](/assets/pdf/slides_acdl2023_L2.pdf), [Lecture 3](/assets/pdf/slides_acdl2023_L3.pdf).

### Statistical Physics view of theory of Machine Learning

Short 1h30 tutorial I gave at [ACDL 2022](https://acdl2022.icas.cc/). I have prepared some high-level [slides](/assets/pdf/slides_acdl2022.pdf) and covered one detailed classic calculation in the field, namely the deterministic limit of one-pass SGD dynamics for two-layers neural networks, highlighting also some recent developments from [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00293) that appeared NeurIPS 2022. You can this in the [lecture notes](/assets/pdf/notes_acdl2022.pdf)  

### Statistical Physics For Optimization and Learning

Between 2020-2022 I was a teaching assistant (TA) for this advanced course on statistical physics methods for learning, constraint satisfaction and inference problems taught by Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborov√° at EPFL. Lecture notes, exercises and corrections can be found in the [course webpage](https://sphinxteam.github.io/EPFLDoctoralLecture2021/).

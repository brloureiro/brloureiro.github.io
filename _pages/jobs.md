### Post-doc opening

I am currently looking for a strong and motivated postdoc to work on the theory of feature learning on the JCJC 2025 project MAPLE (*Mathematical Analysis of Pattern Learning and Extraction*). The desired profile is a student with background in either *theoretical computer science*, *applied mathematics* and/or *statistical physics*. Strongly motivated candidates in other areas of theoretical physics might also fit.

Prospective candidates should [contact me](mailto:bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) with:
- A motivation letter.
- A detailed up-to-date academic CV.
- 2 contacts for recommendation letters, ideally from supervisors and/or academic collaborators. 

The position is funded for 2 years, with earliest starting date September 2025.  

### Prospective post-docs

If you want to join my group as a postdoc, there are different opportunities to keep an eye on:

- [Laplace Postdoctoral Chair in Data Science](https://data-ens.github.io/jobs/):  This is an independent postdoctoral position based at the Centre for Data Science (CSD) at ENS. Applications open annually around December/January. Candidates must be endorsed by a CSD member they'd like to work with. If you're considering applying with my group, please reach out with your CV and a motivation letter.

- [Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships):  A prestigious European-funded independent postdoc position. Applicants propose a project in collaboration with a host lab. The call typically closes around September/October each year. If you'd like to apply with my group as your host, feel free to [contact me](mailto:bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) with your CV and a project outline. I’m happy to provide feedback and support throughout the application process.

- [PRAIRIE Fellow in Artificial Intelligence](https://prairie-institute.fr/fellow-in-artificial-intelligence-m-f/): This independent postdoctoral position is funded by [PRAIRIE](https://prairie-institute.fr/). Applicants must choose a host lab affiliated with PRAIRIE. If you're interested in joining the [DATA](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/) team and working with me, please [get in touch](mailto:bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) with your CV and a motivation letter.

- **Other opportunities**: Even if no open positions are currently listed, I may occasionally have funding available for postdocs on specific projects. If you have a strong background in high-dimensional probability or statistical physics and are interested in working with my group, feel free to [contact me](mailto:bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) with your CV to inquire about potential openings.

### Prospective PhD students

Prospective PhD students are encouraged to [contact me](mailto:bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) with their CV and academic transcripts. I generally follow the French academic calendar (see below), which unfortunately differs from the timeline of graduate applications in many other countries. However, if you're an international student with a strong background in statistical physics and/or applied mathematics, feel free to reach out — I'm happy to discuss potential opportunities on a case-by-case basis.

**A note about the French system**: In France, graduate students typically complete a 3-month research internship ("stage de master") between April and June at the lab where they intend to pursue their PhD. This internship period also coincides with the application cycle for PhD scholarships, which usually takes place around May. These internships offer a valuable opportunity for students to become familiar with their prospective supervisor and research topic. I usually begin discussions with interested candidates between October and early December of the preceding year, and make final selections by late December.

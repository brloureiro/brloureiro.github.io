### PhD fellowship on "Theoretical Investigation of Variational Inference in High-Dimensions"

Together with my colleague [Marylou Gabrié](https://marylou-gabrie.github.io/) (LPENS), we are currently looking for **strong and motivated** students to work on a project on the theoretical investigation of mode collapse. This PhD thesis will take place in the context of the PR[AI]RIE-PSAI cluster, and a project proposal can be found [here](/assets/pdf/phdproject.pdf).

Interested candidates should contact Bruno Loureiro (bruno.loureiro@di.ens.fr) and Marylou Gabrié (marylou.gabrie@ens.fr) until **Thursday 15/05/2025** with the following information:

- A CV.
- A 1 page motivation letter describing your interest and fit for this project.

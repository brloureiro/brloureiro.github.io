I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/") researcher based at the [Centre for Data Science](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris working on the crossroads between machine learning and statistical mechanics.

If you are interested in my research, you can find a complete list of my publications [here](./publications/).

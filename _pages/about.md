I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher in the [DATA team](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/), part of the [Centre for Data Science](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris. My work lies at the intersection of machine learning and statistical mechanics. I also serve as a *Professeur Attaché* at Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL), where I teach in both undergraduate and graduate programs across its affiliated institutions.

If you are interested in my research, you can find a complete list of my publications [here](./publications/).

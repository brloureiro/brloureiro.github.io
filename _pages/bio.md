Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/) working on the crossroads between machine learning and statistical mechanics.

Before moving to Lausanne, I was a postdoc at the [Institut de Physique Th√©orique](https://www.ipht.fr/)(IPhT) in Paris, where I started working on the statistical mechanics of learning.

Before moving to Paris, I read the part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge, and continued into a PhD at the [TCM group](https://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/) in the same university. During my PhD I worked on the [Holographic Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a duality stemming from string theory that relates quantum field theories to classical theories of gravity. [My thesis](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/277911) was centred on applications of this duality to strongly coupled condensed matter systems, with a particular focus on disordered systems.

Although all of that sounds very different from my current research, it is funny to note that many of the methods I employed at the time are the same as in my current topic. In the end, Physics is all about Gaussian integrals, isn't it?

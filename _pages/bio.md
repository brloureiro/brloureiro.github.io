I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher based at the Centre for Data Science at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris working on the crossroads between machine learning and statistical mechanics. I also hold an Adjunct professor ("*Professeur Attaché*") position at the Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) where I teach at the undergraduate and graduate programs of the affiliated universities. 

Before moving to CNRS & ENS, I was a postdoc at the [Institut de Physique Théorique](https://www.ipht.fr/) (IPhT) in Paris and at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (EPFL) in Lausanne, where I worked with [Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/) and [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/).

Before my postdoc, I read the part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge, and continued into a PhD at the [TCM group](https://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/) in the same university. During my PhD I worked on the [Holographic Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a duality stemming from string theory that relates quantum field theories to classical theories of gravity. [My thesis](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/277911) was centred on applications of this duality to strongly coupled condensed matter systems, with a particular focus on disordered systems.

Although all of that sounds very different from my current research, it is funny to note that many of the methods I employed at the time are the same as in my current topic. In the end, Physics is all about Gaussian integrals, isn't it?

## Course Description

This course is a continuation of the "Statistical Learning I" course taught at the 2nd year (L2) of the *Double Licence Intelligence Artificielle et Sciences des Organisations* (IASO) undergraduate from Universit√© Paris-Dauphine.

Our goal is to build a basic understanding of the mathematics behind some of the classical machine learning algorithms, such as:

- Least squares regression
- Ridge regression
- LASSO
- Logistic regression
- Kernel methods
- Random features regression
- PCA

As well as the most widely used optimisation algorithms used to train them, such as stochastic gradient descent.

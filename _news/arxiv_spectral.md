In our [recent pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02545) on *"Optimal Spectral Transitions in High-Dimensional Multi-Index Models"* we propose a spectral method and show that it achieves the optimal weak-recovery threshold for multi-index models among first order methods, a result proven in our [previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15480).

Gaussianity of the input data is a classic assumption in high-dimensional statistics. Although this might seen unrealistic at a first sight, due to strong universality properties it turns out that this assumption not so stringent in high-dimensions. This is the subject of our recent work [*Gaussian Universality of Linear Classifiers with Random Labels in High-Dimension*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13303)! Check it out!

[*Are Gaussian data all you need? Extents and limits of universality in high-dimensional generalized linear estimation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08923), work done in collaboration with Luca Pesce, Florent Krzakala and Ludovic Stephan is now out on arXiv. In this work, we derive sufficient conditions under which the training and generalisation errors of a generalized linear model trained on a multi-modal Gaussian mixture model is equivalent to the errors of the same model trained on a single moded Gaussian cloud.  Check it out!

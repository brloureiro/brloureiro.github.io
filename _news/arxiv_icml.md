A couple of exiting projects I have been working for the past year are finally out on arXiv. Check them out!

- [Theoretical characterization of uncertainty in high-dimensional linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03295)
- [Phase diagram of Stochastic Gradient Descent in high-dimensional two-layer neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00293)
- [Fluctuations, Bias, Variance & Ensemble of Learners: Exact Asymptotics for Convex Losses in High-Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13383)
- [Error Rates for Kernel Classification under Source and Capacity Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12655)
- [Bayesian Inference with Nonlinear Generative Models: Comments on Secure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09986)

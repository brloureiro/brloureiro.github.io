One of the most classical results in high-dimensional learning theory provides a closed-form expression for the generalisation error of binary classification with the single-layer teacher-student perceptron on i.i.d. Gaussian inputs. Surprisingly, an analogous analysis for the corresponding multi-class teacher-student perceptron was missing. In our new work [*Learning curves for the multi-class teacher-student perceptron*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12094) we fill this gap! Check it out!

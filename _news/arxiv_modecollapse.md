A major challenge in variational inference (VI is mode collapse: the phenomenon where a model concentrates on a few modes of the target distribution during training, despite being statistically capable of expressing them all. In the [recent pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13300) we provide a theoretical perspective on mode collapse in VI with Gaussian mixture models.

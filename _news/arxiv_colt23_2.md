[*Universality laws for Gaussian mixtures in generalized linear models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08933) work done in collaboration with Yatin Dandi, Ludovic Stephan, Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborov√° is now out on arXiv. In this work, we generalise recent universality results to settings of interest such as mixture models, ensembling and uncertainty quantification. Check it out!

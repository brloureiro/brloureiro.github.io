Gaussian ensembles of deep random neural networks have recently made a come back as it was shown they can, in some situations, capture the generalisation behaviour of trained networks. In our [recent pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13999), we provide an exact asymptotic analysis of the training of the last layer of such ensembles.

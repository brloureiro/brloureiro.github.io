Our paper [*From high-dimensional & mean-field dynamics to dimensionless ODEs: A unifying approach to SGD in two-layers networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05882) in collaboration with Luca Arnaboldi, Florent Krzakala and Ludovic Stephan has been accepted for a poster at the [Conference on Learning Theory (COLT)](https://learningtheory.org/colt2023/). Come discuss with us in Bangalore!

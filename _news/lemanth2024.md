Together with my colleagues Vittorio Erba (EPFL) and Florent Krzakala (EPFL), I am organising the *Lausanne event on machine learning & neural network theory* ([LemanTh](https://lemanth2024.github.io/)) from May 27-29, 2024. Join in the beautiful city of Lausanne to discuss the recent progress in machine learning theory with an amazing lineup of speakers.

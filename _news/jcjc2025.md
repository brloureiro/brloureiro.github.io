My project MAPLE (*Mathematical Analysis of Pattern Learning and Extraction*) has been selected for the [ANR JCJC 2025](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/aapg-appel-a-projets-generique-2025/)!!! I am actively looking for strong and motivated postdocs to work on the theory of feature learning starting from September 2025. More info [here](/jobs/).

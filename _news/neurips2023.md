Our paper [*Universality laws for Gaussian mixtures in generalized linear modelss*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08933) in collaboration with Yatin Dandi, Ludovic Stephan, Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborov√° has been accepted for a poster at the [Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc/). I will be also presenting our recent work [*Escaping mediocrity: how two-layer networks learn hard generalized linear models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18502) as an oral contribution to the [Optimization for Machine Learning](https://opt-ml.org/) workshop. Come discuss with us in New Orleans!

Two exiting projects I have been working for the past year are finally out on arXiv. Check them out!

- [Dimension-free deterministic equivalents for random feature regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15699)
- [Fundamental limits of weak learnability in high-dimensional multi-index models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15480)
- [Online Learning and Information Exponents: On The Importance of Batch size, and Time/Complexity Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02157)

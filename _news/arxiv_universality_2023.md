Two recent works on universality results for generalised linear models are now out:

- [*Universality laws for Gaussian mixtures in generalized linear models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08933)
- [*Are Gaussian data all you need? Extents and limits of universality in high-dimensional generalized linear estimation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08923)

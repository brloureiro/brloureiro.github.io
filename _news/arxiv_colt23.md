[*From high-dimensional & mean-field dynamics to dimensionless ODEs: A unifying approach to SGD in two-layers networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05882) work done in collaboration with Luca Arnaboldi, Florent Krzakala and Ludovic Stephan is now out on arXiv. In this work, we derive low-dimensional equations for the sufficient statistics of the generalisation error for the training of two-layer neural networks with one-pass SGD, under different limits of interest. Check it out!

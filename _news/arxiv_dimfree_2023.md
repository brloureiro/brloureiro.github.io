Our new paper titled [*From high-dimensional & mean-field dynamics to dimensionless ODEs: A unifying approach to SGD in two-layers networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05882) is now out! In this work, we derive different limits for the one-pass SGD dynamics of two-layer neural networks, including: a) the classical gradient flow limit; b) the high-dimensional limit studied by [Savid Saad & Sara Solla in the 90s](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.4337); c) and the more recent infinite width mean-field limit. Check it out!

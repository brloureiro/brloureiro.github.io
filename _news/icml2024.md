Our three works:
- [*Asymptotics of feature learning in two-layer networks after one gradient-step*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04980)
- [*Asymptotics of Learning with Deep Structured (Random) Features*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13999)
- *Online Learning and Information Exponents: The Importance of Batch size & Time/Complexity Tradeoffs*

were accepted for publication at ICML 2024! See you in Vienna in July!
